# isigy #
isigy, short for "Is it graduation yet," is a simple and stupid Ruby webapp for determining whether or not it's currently a specific date. The intended use is, of course, to determine if it's currently graduation. However, with very minor alterations, it could easily be used for anything else as well. It's not really all that useful, but it exists. Just set the `@grad` variable in `app.rb` and deploy it somewhere. There's a live example for the [West Windsor-Plainsboro](http://www.ww-p.org/) district's Class of 2014 graduation hosted on Heroku [here](http://isgrad.aaronweiss.us/). Have fun!
